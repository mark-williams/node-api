# node-api
Simple evaluation/investigation of a REST api using node/express.

###Initial
A very basic server (GET /ping returns pong).

####
Added a very basic, hard-coded, implementation of a GET request for dogs. Note this has the express 'app' injected in, it then configures routes on this and supplied the data.
